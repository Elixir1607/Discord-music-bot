# Discord-music-bot
This is a music bot for discord channels
Since discord is an openAPI we can create and code bots on our own, ive tried to make a music bot which uses the discord inbuilt library.
The main2.py consists of the main code,music_cog has all the commands for bots and help_cog is for help commands.
FFmpeg is to be installed and set it as default environment in your system to handle urls.
